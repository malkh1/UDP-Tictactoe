# Online_Tictactoe

play tictactoe with your friends using this project i made
uses udp protocol

1 person hosts it on their ip by running the server application
others connect to that players server by using the hosts ip

#UPDATE: ONLY WORKS ON LAN. 


#THERE'S A BUG WHERE THE CLIENT CONNECTING TO HOST NEVER RECEIVES PACKET FROM SERVER.


#SPENT A BIT OF TIME TROUBLESHOOTING, BUT ITS ANNOYING TO PIN POINT WHY CLIENT DOES NOT RECEIVE PACKET.



#COULD BE A FIREWALL THING, MAYBE PORTFORWARDING IDK 


#IF U HAVE ANY IDEAS THEN LET ME KNOW
