# Online_Tictactoe

play tictactoe with your friends using this project i made

uses udp protocol

1 person hosts it on their ip by running the server application

the player hosting the server will then run the client program.

another player will connect to the host using the hosts' ip by entering it into the batch file provided.

the server application supports multiple games going at the same time

#UPDATE: ONLY WORKS ON LAN. 

#THERE'S A BUG WHERE THE CLIENT CONNECTING TO HOST NEVER RECEIVES PACKET FROM SERVER.

#SPENT A BIT OF TIME TROUBLESHOOTING, BUT ITS ANNOYING TO PIN POINT WHY CLIENT DOES NOT RECEIVE PACKET.

#COULD BE A FIREWALL THING, MAYBE PORTFORWARDING IDK 

#IF U HAVE ANY IDEAS THEN LET ME KNOW
